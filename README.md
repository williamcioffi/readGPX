# readGPX

This is a largely unmodified copy of readGPX.R from plotKML (https://github.com/Envirometrix/plotKML).

Recently, plotKML was archived on CRAN (for details see: https://github.com/Envirometrix/plotKML/issues/12) it seems like because one of its dependencies was archived.

The readGPX function seems unaffected and so I've made a copy for continued compatability. The only changes I have made is just to add explicit references to the required XML package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html).

The original code was indicated as being released under GPL but did not specify the version. I have assumed GPL-3.0, but note the complication.
